## About Me

Hi, I'm Hamish Dickson, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer based in London, UK. I specialize in delivering production-ready ML solutions with a focus on NLP, LLMs, and deep learning systems.

Currently, I'm working as a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Contract)** at **Spotify**, where I'm exploring innovative approaches to ad optimization and recommendation systems. I enjoy tackling complex ML challenges and turning research into practical solutions that make a real impact.

## Background

I have over 15 years of experience working across finance, startups, and tech companies. My journey spans from building SaaS solutions for major investment banks to developing ML systems at fast-growing startups like Sprout.ai and DriveTribe.

My academic background is in **Theoretical Physics** from Imperial College London, where I studied Quantum Field Theory, General Relativity, and Quantum Optics.

## Technical Expertise

I work primarily with **Python**, **PyTorch**, and **Hugging Face Transformers**, specializing in:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuning
- NLP and text processing systems
- OCR and document understanding
- Streaming systems and real-time ML
- Reinforcement Learning

I also have spent a great deal of my career working on streaming systems, specifically using Scala, Kafka, and Flink. More recently at Spotify I have been using scio.
