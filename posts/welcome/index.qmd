Hi and thanks for getting this far!

I'm excited to announce that after over 15 years of working in finance and then startups I have decided to become a freelancer!

As part of this I am (re)launching my blog. Most of my old posts have been converted to public notebooks on Kaggle, if you are interested please check them out.

I hope here you will find interesting articles on what I'm working on, techniques I use a lot and hopefully a few demos. It will also act as a way for me to be more contactable... so please get in touch!
