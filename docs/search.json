Unfortunitely I’ve always found the Snowflake docs… lacking or maybe just confusing on what your other options are.\nSo here’s what I found worked:"

Note, I said append, this is a column orientated database designed for large datasets, so it will take you some work to do something more akin to UPSERT.\nHope that helped, contact me on Twitter if you have any questions."
